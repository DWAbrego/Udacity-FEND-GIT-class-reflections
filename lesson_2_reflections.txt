What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates some hidden files that are used to track different versions of the files in your repository.  If you don't do this, git will not think it has a repository, and it will not track your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working - where you are doing the actual work
Staging - groups your changes so you can submit them to repository
Repository - where file versions are stored

I am not sure wht value it offers.
