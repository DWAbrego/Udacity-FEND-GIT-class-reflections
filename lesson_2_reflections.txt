What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates some hidden files that are used to track different versions of the files in your repository.  If you don't do this, git will not think it has a repository, and it will not track your files.


=====

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working - where you are doing the actual work
Staging - groups your changes so you can submit them to repository
Repository - where file versions are stored

I am not sure wht value it offers.

=====
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Don't commit from the staging area until you have made all your changes to all your files for the logical change.
=====

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you want to make changes that are likely to break your project, you can branch.  Keep the new changes isolated in a branch.

=====

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams show a graph of the branches as they occured timewise.  It is a visual representation rather than looking at a list of id numbers.

=====

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

This merges the differences from 2 branches.  It is a way of graphically representing the changes in the branches so that it is easy to visualize.
